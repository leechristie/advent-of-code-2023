## Day 1 - Gear Ratios

### 1. Python (Part 1)

The most obvious way to approach this puzzle seems to be to load everything into a 2D array, such as in `numpy`. However this year I am avoiding all 3rd party libraries. I could just read each line into a `list[str]` or a `list[list[Symbol]]` or something, but instead I decided to use a sliding window of 3 lines at a time.

Currently need to refactor this before doing Part 2.
